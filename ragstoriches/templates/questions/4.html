    You are entering the workforce and looking for a job. You obtained an offer for a 9-5 job with a basic salary of $1000 (the amount can be altered in favour of the board game), with the opportunity of promotion in the near future. In the meantime, you are offered another 
    job with a salary of 2000$ but no opportunity for promotion. 
    Which would you choose?
